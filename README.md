# Cryptocurrency Price Automation

> Status: Finished ✔️

### The idea behind automation is to enter each site of the cryptocurrencies that I have invested and bring some information such as:
### Its current price in reais, its growth in the last 24 hours, and make the total calculation of how much I gained or lost with my investment. 
### And after collecting all that data, automation puts it into a spreadsheet.
